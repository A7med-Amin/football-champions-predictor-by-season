# Football Champions Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the code and documentation for the CMPS451 project titled <b>Predicting Football Champions by Season</b>. The project leverages historical football data to predict which team will win the championship in a given season. This analysis not only satisfies the curiosity of sports enthusiasts but also provides valuable insights for sports analytics firms, and clubs, enhancing decision-making related to investments and team strategies.

It's important to <b>note</b> that we do not endorse or support betting activities. Our focus was solely on leveraging historical football data to predict season champions and enhance decision-making processes related to investments and team strategies.

## Datasets

The primary dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle and is titled "Football Champions by Season", curated by Luis Gaspar Cordeiro. This dataset includes comprehensive historical data on various football leagues' champions across different seasons, making it ideal for analyzing trends and factors that influence championship outcomes.

## Methodology

The project's methodology is designed to be iterative and adaptive, incorporating a comprehensive data processing and analysis pipeline to predict football season champions accurately. The approach is structured into several distinct phases:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Focus on cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and ensuring that team names, seasons, and other categorical variables are consistently represented across the dataset. Feature engineering will also be a critical component of this phase.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct in-depth EDA to uncover underlying patterns, correlations between variables, and potentially predictive insights. This will involve:
- **Visualizing Distributions:** Analyze the distribution of numerical variables, such as the number of wins or goals in a season.
- **Summarizing Categories:** Examine the frequency of championships won by different teams or leagues over the seasons.

### 3. Model Development and Selection
Experiment with machine learning algorithm to find the most effective approach for predicting season champions. The chosen classification model is Logistic Regression.

### 4. Validation and Testing
Employ a rigorous validation strategy, including cross-validation and holdout testing, to assess the generalizability of our models.

### 5. Iterative Refinement
Based on initial testing results and feedback, revisit model configurations, feature engineering, and even preprocessing steps to continuously enhance our predictions.
